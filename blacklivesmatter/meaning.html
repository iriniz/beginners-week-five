    Black Lives Matter is an anthem, a slogan, a hashtag, and a straightforward statement of fact.
    While it is not a new movement, the message is central to the nationwide protests happening right now.
    BLM speaks out against the police brutality and systemic racism that caused the recent deaths of George Floyd,
    Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade and Breonna Taylor, as well as the thousands of violent incidents that happen 
    to Black people that aren’t recorded, aren’t reported or aren’t afforded the outrage they deserve. 
    At its most basic level, it calls for a shift in the statistics that Black people are twice as likely to
    be killed by a police officer while unarmed, compared to a white individual. According to a 2015 study,
    African Americans died at the hands of police at a rate of 7.2 per million, while whites were killed
    at a rate of 2.9 per million.

    One of the goals of the Black Lives Matter movement is to raise awareness that we,
    as a nation, need to reconsider our priorities. Right now, there are U.S. institutions 
    and systems that act as if black lives don't matter. For example, according to a report 
    by American Progress, in 2015, each of the 10 states with the highest percentage of Black 
    residents reported state and local policing expenditures of more than $230 per resident per year.
    That’s at least 328 times more than what each state spends on enforcing anti-discrimination laws.
