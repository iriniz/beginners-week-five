    <h1>How Did Black Lives Matter Start?</h1>

    <p>
    While racism in the United States goes back hundreds of years to the country's founding,
    the Black Lives Matter timeline started much more recently. The movement arose out of 
    the acquittal of George Zimmerman after he killed Trayvon Martin in 2013. Today, the 
    Black Lives Matter Foundation, Inc. is a global organization thatâ€™s active in the U.S.,
    U.K., and Canada, although it has supporters all over the world.
    </p>

    <br>
    <p>
    The BLM guiding principles are to eradicate white supremacy and
    intervene in violence inflicted on Black communities through advocacy,
    fundraising and education. The organization aims to combat and counteract violence
    , amplify Black innovation, and center Black joy.

    On February 23, Ahmaud Arbery, an unarmed 25-year-old African-American man,
    was fatally shot while jogging in Glynn County, Georgia. Arbery had 
    been pursued and confronted by three white residents driving two vehicles,
    including a father and son who were armed. All three men have been 
    indicted on nine counts, including felony murder.

    On March 13, Louisville police officers knocked down the apartment door
    of 26-year-old African American Breonna Taylor, serving a no-knock search
    warrant for drug suspicions. Police fired several shots during the encounter
    which led to her death. Her boyfriend who was present at the time had called
    911 and said, "someone kicked in the door and shot my girlfriend".
    Protests were held in Louisville with calls for police reform.

    On May 25, Christian Cooper, a black bird-watcher at New York's Central Park
    experienced a confrontation with a white woman after he asked her to put
    her dog on a leash in the Ramble, a no-dogs-off-leash area. The interaction
    escalated when the white woman called the police to say that an African
    American man was threatening her. On July 6, the Manhattan
    District Attorney's office announced that the woman would be charged with
    falsely reporting an incident in the third degree.
